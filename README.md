# Password validator kata
The task of today is to design a password verification program.

The password verification program will take a password as an argument and the password will be valid only if all these conditions are correct:

- Contains at least 8 characters
- Contains at least one capital letter
- Contains at least one lowercase letter
- Contains at least a number
- Contains at least a special character in this list . * # @ $ % &.
- Any other characters are not authorized.
  
In this program, the only thing that matters is to know if the password is valid. Not why it is not.

Nevertheless, for the magic to work properly, you will need to follow the TDD rules. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
